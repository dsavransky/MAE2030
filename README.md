# dynamicsMATLAB
MATLAB functions and scripts for sophomore dynamics class (Cornell MAE 2030, Princeton MAE 206). Based on Engineering Dynamics by Kasdin &amp; Paley (2011).

These programs are intended to demonstrate various aspects of dynamics and numerical integration and animation of dynamical systems with MATLAB. The examples are largely based on the textbook Engineering Dynamics by Kasdin  &amp; Paley and serve as supplementary materials to the text and associated lectures.

All files have been tested in MATLAB R2014a and R2015a but should work in any release after R2009b.

The subdirectory Shared contains common resources used in multiple functions and should be added to the MATLAB path.

The codes are split into chapter directories that (sometimes roughly) match the contents of the textbook chapters.

Comments, questions, and additions are very welcome.
