# MAE 2030
MATLAB functions and scripts and Jupyter Python notebooks for sophomore dynamics class (Cornell MAE 2030, Princeton MAE 206). Based on Engineering Dynamics by Kasdin &amp; Paley (2011).

These programs are intended to demonstrate various aspects of dynamics and numerical integration and animation of dynamical systems with MATLAB. The examples are largely based on the textbook Engineering Dynamics by Kasdin  &amp; Paley and serve as supplementary materials to the text and associated lectures.

MATLAB code was tested in R2016b, but should work in any version after R2014b. Some plot commands may not work in earlier releases, other functionality should work in any release after 2009a.

For static views of the Jupyter Notebooks go to http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dsavransky/MAE2030/blob/master/Notebooks/ 
These notebooks are written in Python 2.7.12 and use Sympy 1.0. They also use sympyhelpers.py from https://github.com/dsavransky/miscpy/blob/master/utils/sympyhelpers.py

The subdirectory Shared contains common resources used in multiple functions and should be added to the MATLAB path.

The codes are split into chapter directories that (somewhat roughly) match the contents of the textbook chapters.

Comments, questions, and additions are very welcome.
